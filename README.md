A simple python program that will help you learn Spanish vocabulary as it pops up a new Spanish word after ever 10 mins. <br>
This time interval can be changed very simply in the code.

And yeah, i forgot to tell you another nice thing, <br>
You can close the program and when you restart the program ,it will start from where you left. <br>
I did this by using a very simple text file as log file. <br>
If you wanna change the index manually, go to log_last.txt . <br>

# Changing popup time
If you wanna change the time for the popup, then
refer to line 22 in code
